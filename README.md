## 2. Student Exam Performance Prediction Page
Users can input student details such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation course completion, writing score, and reading score.
A button labeled "Predict your Maths Score" triggers the machine learning model to generate a prediction.

## 3. Prediction Output
After entering the required inputs, the app provides a predicted maths score based on the modelâ€™s trained data.
This prediction helps in analyzing student performance trends.
